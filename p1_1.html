      <h3>BANANA STORY</h3>
      <div class="box">
      <p1>I want to write an overview of what banana is and what is the difference,
        if any, between banana and plantain. A short history of the fruit and its origins,
        and maybe add a list of “fun facts” about the banana. Lastly, I want to write about
        why bananas are good for you and maybe had a little recipe of some sort.</p1>

      <h3>MYTHICAL CREATURE</h3>
      <div class="box">
        <p1>If I will write about a mythical creature, it is most likely be a Slavic culture.
        I will write a history of a creature, visual characteristics, and the place of habitat.</p1>

      <h3>UKRAINE</h3>
      <div class="box">
      <p1>As a Ukrainian I want people to know that Ukraine is its own country not
        a part of Russia or a town in Russia. If I choose this topic I will write a
        short History of Ukraine, overview of geographic characteristics. Also,
        I will write about its culture and language.</p1>
