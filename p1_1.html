      <h3>BANANA STORY</h3>
      <div class="box">
      <p1>I want to write an overview of what a banana is and what, if any,
        differences exist between bananas and plantains. This would include
        a short history of the fruit and its origins, along with a list of
        “fun facts” about the banana. Lastly, I want to write about why bananas
        are a healthy food choice and potentially include a recipe of some sort. </p1>

      <h3>MYTHICAL CREATURE</h3>
      <div class="box">
        <p1>If I will write about a mythical creature, it will most likely be
          a creature from a Slavic culture. I will write a history of the creature
          I choose, describe its visual characteristics, and provide information
          regarding where the creature resides.</p1>

      <h3>UKRAINE</h3>
      <div class="box">
      <p1>As an immigrant originally from Ukraine, I want people to know that Ukraine
        is its own sovereign country and not a ‘state’ or town within Russia.
        If I choose this topic, I will write a short history of Ukraine, provide
        an overview of its geographic characteristics, and inform the audience
        of the Ukrainian language and culture.</p1>
