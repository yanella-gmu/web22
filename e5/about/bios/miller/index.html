      <h1>Rellim Miller</h1>
      <p class="large-text">Rellim Miller is a confusing member of the studio. Rellim always does things forward and then backward leading to a lot of work getting done and then all of it getting taken back. It is a complicated process that has not been very useful so far.</p>

      <h2>Link #7</h2>
      <p>Link the text in the button below to the work page.</p>
      <button><h6><a href="../../../work/index.html">Work</a></h6></button>
      <h2>CSS #7</h2>
      <p>Make the h1 smaller when the screen is smaller than 800px. Make sure the other text is sized proportionally to the new h1 size meaning an h2 shouldn't be larger than an h1. Don't forget about the large-text class too.</p>
